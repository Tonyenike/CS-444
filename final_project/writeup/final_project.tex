\begin{abstract}

\noindent This is the Undergrad Final write-up for group 7 of CS 444. We explore how to build a kernel for the Raspberry PI on the os2 server, as well as learning how to modify the drivers for the GPIO pins on the PI. We can assign 2 GPIO pins to function as a transmitter and a receiver in order to be able to send and receive morse code with any given speed.

\section{Write Up}

\textbf{1. What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}
Being able to build a kernel for the Raspberry PI, and also being able to modify GPIO pins in order to send and receive morse code between other Raspberry PIs with the same functionality. Another point for the project was being able to change the speeds at which the morse code is being transmitted or received individually. It is important to know how to create and modify drivers when working with kernels. \\

\noindent \textbf{2. How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.}
We took some contents from the morse trigger, modified and added a few things, and created our own driver that uses GPIO pins to send and receive morse code. We had to modify the Makefile and Kconfig in order to accommodate our driver when building the kernel. We also had to create a file called \verb|morsegpio.c| which was the morse driver code itself. \\


\noindent \textbf{3. How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.}
We started out by using print statements to see if the kernel was built and running properly. We then realized that we couldn't get anything to print to the console, even though we used the right function, but later on we figured out how to. When it came to testing if the transmitter pin and receiver pin are working correctly, we had to build the kernel every time to check and see if the morse codes for inputs strings were correct, as well as the speeds were reflected by changes requested to the SYSfs system. In order to test the requested pins, we tried different GPIO pins for the transmission and reception to see if the morse code still works. We also tried different strings with various lengths, mixture of upper-case and lower-case letters, and using different characters besides the alphabet. \\


\noindent \textbf{4. What did you learn?}
We learned how to build a Raspberry PI kernel. Specifically, we were able to create a morse code from any input string and have the transmitter pin send it, while the receiver pin get the code and decode it back into words. We also learned how to have the user change the speed at which the pins send and receive, as well as having the user change which GPIO pins be for transmitting and receiving morse code. Another thing we learned was how to use a character device that allows any kind of input string to be transformed into morse code and back into words. \\

\noindent \textbf{5. How should the TA evaluate your work? Provide detailed steps to prove correctness.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the Raspbian OS by going to \verb|https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/| and choosing "Raspbian Stretch Lite"
\item Download Etcher by going to \verb|https://www.balena.io/etcher/| and choosing one for your OS
\item Flash the Raspbian OS onto the SD card for the Raspberry PI using Etcher
\item Open the root directory of the SD card (by plugging it into its USB thingy and into your machine) and add \verb|kernel=kernel8.img| and \verb|enable_uart=1| to the config.txt file.
\item Ensure that the "code" directory is in the same directory as the "linux" directory. If no linux directory exists, it will get created in the directory above the present working directory.
\item Run the "builder" script to build and patch the kernel. If you get any prompts from the patcher, answer no ("n"). This means that you have previously built and are trying to build again, but the patcher will think to reverse the changes. 
\item The image will be outside the linux directory (in the same directory as where "linux" and "code" are housed). It will be called "kernel8.img"
\item Copy the "kernel8.img" to the SD card \\
\end{enumerate}

Here is how we created the patches (but you DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS TO RUN OUR CODE!)
\begin{enumerate}
\item After finishing our work on the \verb|morsegpio.c| file, we did \verb|diff -u ledtrig-morse.c morsegpio.c > morsegpio.patch| to produce the \verb|morsegpio.patch| file. 
\item We made a copy of the Makefile (in the trigger directory) and called it Makefileold. We modified the Makefile as necessary. Then we did \verb|diff -u Makefileold Makefile > Makefile.patch| to produce the \verb|Makefile.patch| file.
\item We made a copy of the Kconfig (in the trigger directory) and called it Kconfigold. We modified the Kconfig as necessary. Then we did \verb|diff -u Kconfigold Kconfig > Kconfig.patch| to produce the \verb|Kconfig.patch| file.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Work log}

The majority of the project was completed on Tuesday, December 4, 2018. We saved the writeup and the testing on Thursday, December 6, 2018. That made our work log real spicy for the first day we worked on it. Nickoli did most of the work for the write-up and Ben did most of the coding for GPIO driver. This worked out really well because Ben hates writing. Our group will continue this work pattern in the future. Our original group was a group of two, so we decided to work as group 7 again for this project.
